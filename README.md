Pixel Mouse is a team-based project that allows members to learn new electrical engineering concepts based on their current skill level. There are 2 categories of what you can create as a member-- a breadboard or a PCB controller. The workshops cover information on introductory electrical engineering concepts, Arduino, button/joystick implementation, soldering, and PCB design. Participating members will form groups with one team leader to complete the design.

Pixel Mouse is also a custom-made timed maze game that teams can compete in for a prize. A list of the hotkeys coded into the game can guide you in how you implement the game controller, and a variety of hardware is introduced into the workshops to help you design a unique game controller. After teams finish building their game controllers, we will host an end-of-project competition to play Pixel Mouse, and gift cards will be given to the winners of the game.

This project is also an entry for the 2024 IEEE Rising Stars Conference's project showcase, an opportunity for people to present an original technical project.
